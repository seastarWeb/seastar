With this in mind we worked hard with Olympic Warranties to come up with  a 12 month warranty cover on ALL non competition machines under 10 years old that should put your mind completely to rest. The details of the covers offered vary slightly upon the age of the motorcycle concerned. Below are the facts in black &amp; white. </p>

<strong>Gold Policy</strong>
: For bikes under 5 years old - £500 per claim for a 12 month period.
